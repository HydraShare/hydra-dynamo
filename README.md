[Hydra](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra#hydra) is a web platform that allows users to share example files from [Dynamo](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo) directly to the [Hydra Web Repo](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/) using GitHub.  You can efficiently export your scripts to the Hydra repository using the Dynamo node for sharing and community interaction! There are a number of built in features to help organize, categorize, and preview your files online without having to download to make sure you are getting exactly what you expect.

Hydra started at the [2015 AEC TECH Hackathon](http://aec-technology-hackathon-2015.devpost.com/) and was one of the two winners for best collaboration and opensource development. The project started by: [Chris](https://github.com/chriswmackey), [Keith](https://github.com/alfarok), [Matthew](https://github.com/mdahlhausen) and [Mostapha](https://github.com/mostapharoudsari). You can read the full story [here](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra#hydra).

This repository only contains the [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.com) node for Hydra.
Learn how to use the node to create Hydras [here](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra-dynamo/wiki)
You can also find support for the Hydra [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/) component [here](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra-grasshopper)

## Don't share files, share Hydras!
